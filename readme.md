# Lemondial üçã

With this device, you can experience the full range of Lemongrab's signature screeching at the twist of a dial.

To use the device, simply turn the dial to increase the intensity of the Lemongrab sound. The more you turn the dial, the more annoying and unbearable the sound will become, just like Lemongrab himself.

Please be advised that this device is intended for novelty purposes only and may cause extreme discomfort to those around you. Use at your own risk.
